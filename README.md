## Challenges 


### Challenge One: Find Duplicates In a String

[Link](https://www.codewars.com/kata/54bf1c2cd5b56cc47f0007a1/train/python)

Write a function that will return the count of distinct case-insensitive alphabetic characters and numeric digits that occur more than once in the input string. The input string can be assumed to contain only alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase) and numeric digits.

Example
```
"abcde" -> 0 # no characters repeats more than once
"aabbcde" -> 2 # 'a' and 'b'
"aabBcde" -> 2 # 'a' occurs twice and 'b' twice (`b` and `B`)
"indivisibility" -> 1 # 'i' occurs six times
"Indivisibilities" -> 2 # 'i' occurs seven times and 's' occurs twice
"aA11" -> 2 # 'a' and '1'
"ABBA" -> 2 # 'A' and 'B' each occur twice
```

### Challenge Two:

Some numbers have funny properties. For example:

89 --> 8¹ + 9² = 89 * 1

695 --> 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 * 2

46288 --> 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688 = 46288 * 51

Given a positive integer n written as abcd... (a, b, c, d... being digits) and a positive integer p

we want to find a positive integer k, if it exists, such as the sum of the digits of n taken to the successive powers of p is equal to k * n.
In other words:

Is there an integer k such as : (a ^ p + b ^ (p+1) + c ^(p+2) + d ^ (p+3) + ...) = n * k

If it is the case we will return k, if not return -1.

Note: n and p will always be given as strictly positive integers.

```
dig_pow(89, 1) should return 1 since 8¹ + 9² = 89 = 89 * 1
dig_pow(92, 1) should return -1 since there is no k such as 9¹ + 2² equals 92 * k
dig_pow(695, 2) should return 2 since 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 * 2
dig_pow(46288, 3) should return 51 since 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688 = 46288 * 51

```
